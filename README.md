# craytracer

A simple ray tracer written in c. 
Eventually it will take in parameters from a text file like resolution, camera position, fov and a list of shapes/triangles with color info then create a ppm image file from that info.

Currently the parameters and objects in the scene are all hard coded and lighting is just black or white.

I did something similar as an assignment a few years ago but seem to have lost the files so figured it would be a good warmup to jog my memory and get back into programming. Trying to do as much as I can from memory and working through it on my own.
